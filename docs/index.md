# Overview

This course provides an introduction and overview to developing ["cloud native"](https://www.cncf.io/) or "cloud first"
applications. The course is a set of 10 one-hour 
lectures that cover, at a high level, the core concepts. The accompanying
material provides examples of each of the concepts. The lectures suggest simple projects that students can implement
to get firsthand experience with the technology. The material focuses on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/),
but the concepts apply to any cloud model.
